    "The first class, Agent is an abstract base class with the attributes of name, preference, and if it has a match, but it is overall defining a blueprint for matching participants. The proposer and Proposee class are the subclasses to Agent that take the input of the agent class and can make objects in the two groups. The proposer class makes proposals and the proposee either takes or rejects the proposal based on its preferences, to facilitate matches."

This simplifies to O(n²) for the algorithm runnning time meaning it is polynomial in the size of the array and would be considered somewhat efficient (for purposes of this question).

This algorithm is different in that it only iterates once while maintaining/ updating a running sum vs the prevous alogrithm which checks for every single possible subarray. This algorithm also gets the time efficiency of O(n) since it goes through only once as opposed to a nested loop O(n^2) that we've seen in the previous."
